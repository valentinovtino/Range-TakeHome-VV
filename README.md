### Prompt

Write a client app that helps a group of people share their favorite lunch spots and decide which one to grap lunch from each day. The primary interface should be a web app with the following capabilities:

1. People can click a button to get a random lunch sport suggestion. The app should choose a suggestion from the available options and display the result in an appealing and easy-to-read format.
  -Lunch spot name
  -Address 
  -Link for more info
  -Any other info you'd like to include
2. People can 'Spin Again' if they don't like the random suggestion they get.
3. People can add additional spot to the database of options by filling out a form. 
4. The UI should work equally well at desktop and phone viewport sizes.
5. Should be able to add data to the database, validate data, and handle any errors.
